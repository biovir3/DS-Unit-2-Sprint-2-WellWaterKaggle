    "\tAs I started this, my first goal was to get a starting baseline. I happen to be a random forest fan, so I picked the Random Forest Classifier in the sklearn library. For the baseline, I grabbed the numerical features that were already available and ran the model on them unchanged. This gave me a baseline in the 70% range. While I was happy with this, I knew I could do better. This is how I got a better score, and a few of the things I learned along the way."

    "\tFor this project we were given from Monday until Thursday to complete all of our submissions in order to model the answer to the status of each well. My first baseline was crude, rude, and inelegant. I also knew there were more ways to attack this problem than I would have the time to explore. I did discover that Brute Force is an effective way to get a decent answer, but what good is that, and I know it wonâ€™t work in many situations. I explored more, and given the data and the way I was working with it, my best resource was the random forest classifier, and I returned to it quite often. I also want to mention the biggest bottleneck that I was forced to deal with, I came to realize that the time waiting on algorithms to fit to the data is quite signifigant, and requires planning to maximize productivity."
